#Sales Overview By Outlet
We are able to identify the weekly sales revenue for the selected shop, and also see the distribution of sales revenue generated by product genre. On top of that, we are able to identify the peak period(spike in number of transactions at certain period of the day), which can allow management to allocate more manpower to ease workload and traffic flow.

As mentioned earlier, pastry wastage is an issue that the company should be addressing. Using the visualizations above, we are able to identify the products that has the highest wastage. Ginger Scone, Almond Croissant and Chocolate Croissant ranked the top 3 for wastage, with Ginger Scone having more wastage losses than its sales revenue. Using these visuals, the company can possibly cut down amount of pastries prepared to minimize losses.

In this, we are able to identify the top spenders and the top products that generates the highest sales revenue. With the visuals, the company can make use of these insights to run promotions on these items to boost sales. On top of that, the company can also R&D more products similar to their popular existing products.
